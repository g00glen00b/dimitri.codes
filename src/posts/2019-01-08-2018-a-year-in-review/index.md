As usual, the beginning of a new year is a good time to reflect on the previous year. For me, that meant the return of writing more blogposts, so I'm quite satisfied. Anyhow, let's recap some important analytics!

### Visitors

As I predicted last year, the site has pretty much reached a "ceiling" that's difficult to get through. Many of the articles that gained some popularity are becoming outdated, and that means that the new articles that are being written simply act as a replacement for the old ones.

Many of the new articles are doing great though, with the rewrite of my [validating your REST API with Spring](http://wordpress.g00glen00b.be/validating-the-input-of-your-rest-api-with-spring/) being the top article, and even gaining more traction than before.

Additionally, my blogposts about JWT and the one about monitoring with Grafana are doing great as well!

Still, we did have **266.000** visitors last year, and for that, I would like to thank every one of you!

### What now?

In 2019 I'd like to explore some web technologies, such as WebRTC. Considering that my blogposts about WebSockets were my initial popular articles, I'm also planning to revise those.

Additionally, I'm going to look more into reactive programming with Spring boot, and explore projects such as [RSocket](http://rsocket.io/) and [rdbc](https://rdbc.io/). Considering how popular my monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana tutorial was, I'm also going to take a look at [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io/).

A third "pillar" I want to take a look at is the beautiful world of containers. Think about Docker, Kubernetes, Istio and more!

Finally, (if there is some time left), I'm also going to take a look at serverless programming and explore frameworks such as Micronaut.
