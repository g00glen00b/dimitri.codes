You probably are aware that there is a lot of controversy on the world wide web nowadays regarding privacy.
Websites appear to track you in various ways, and it’s as if most organizations don’t even care about your privacy.

Generally, we try to keep privacy in mind when changing features on this website.
On this page you’ll find detailed (and sometimes technical) information about what’s being tracked and how.

### So... what data do you collect?

We’ve prevented people from signing up for this website, got rid of any ad revenue, and disabled social sharing buttons and Disqus to keep the amount of data that’s being collected to a minimum.

We are using two third party services that do collect information though, being Google Analytics and Google Fonts.

**Google Analytics** collects information about the requests that are being send, such as:

- Browser and system information (such as the name and version of your browser, the type of operating system, …).
- Information about the page you’re visiting (such as which tutorial are you looking at).
- Information about the page you come from (how did you find this tutorial? which link did you click?).
- An anonymized IP address. IP addresses are personally identifying information (commonly abbreviated as PII). This is why we’ve configured Google Analytics to only use an [anonymized version of your IP address](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) so that it can’t be traced back to a real person or entity.

Additionally, we’re making use of **Google Fonts**, which collects a [limited amount of information](https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq?hl=en#what-does-using-the-google-fonts-api-mean-for-the-privacy-of-my-users), such as the amount of times a font is used.

### Why do you collect that information?

We’re using **Google Analytics** so that we can determine which tutorials and technologies are considered popular, and which aren’t.
This allows us to focus on technologies that are interesting, rather than spending it on tutorials that aren’t interesting.

Additionally it allows us to keep track about what type of device is being used to visit this website.
If more people use mobile devices, we might need to do more to make this website mobile-friendly.

On the other hand, we use **Google Fonts** to optimize this website.
Google Fonts allows us to create a more unique look-and-feel, without suffering from performance-issues due to additional load times.

### What cookies do you store?

We do not store any **first-party cookie**, meaning that none of the assets provided by our website use cookies.

The only **third-party cookies** we use are the ones that are necessary by Google Analytics to distinguish users, such as:

- `_ga`: This cookie expires after **2 years** and is used to distinguish users.
- `_gat`: This cookie is used to throttle the request rate of calling Google Analytics, and expires after **1 minute**.
- `_gid`: This cookie is also used to distinguish users, and expires after **24 hours**.

### I don't want to be tracked, what now?

We do not offer any measures to opt-in or opt-out, as that would require an additional cookie to remember your choice to opt-out, or we would have to ask you each time whether or not you want to opt-out or not.

There are browser extensions that do help you with this though, such as [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) or a typical content filter extension, such as an Ad Blocker or [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases).
